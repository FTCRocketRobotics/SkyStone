How to simultaneously connect to 2 Wi-Fi networks.

Use case:  Primary networks attached to Internet.  Secondary network attached 
to Robot Controller.

Setup:
To start, you need to have a profile associated with the Wi-Fi ssid on the
interface that you want to use.
	1. Press windows button and type in "Network Connections"
	2. Right-click on the interface that you want to use for Internet and 
	   select "Disable".  Don't worry, we'll enable it after we associate
	   the Robot Controller with the secondary interface.
	3. Connect to the Wi-Fi Direct network like you normally would.  You
	   should see that the connection is on the secondary Wi-Fi interface
	   now.
	4. Right-click on the primary interface and select "Enable".  You 
	   should now be connected to both Wi-Fi networks.
	
Troubleshooting:
	1. If you already have a Wi-Fi profile that associates the primary 
	   interface to the Wi-Fi Direct network that you want to use, you 
	   will have to "Forget" that network.
	   1.a Press windows button and type in "Wi-Fi settings"
	   1.b Select the target network and select "Forget"
	2. If the adb is not connecting, try the "Restart Robot" command from
	   either the Robot Controller Driver Station
	   


Useful commands:

Determine what devices are attached to adb:
	adb devices
	
Enable a Robot Controller to "listen" to adb connections over Wi-Fi:
	1. Connect USB-B to USB-micro cable to Robot Controller
	2. run command: adb tcpip 5555
	3. Disconnect cable, settings will be retained until next power cycle 
	   of the Robot Controller.
	
Connect Android Studio to Robot Controller over Wi-Fi:
	1. Ensure Wi-Fi connection on Robot Controller network is active.
	2. run command: adb connect 192.168.49.1:5555
	
Disconnect Android Studio from Robot Controller:
	1. run command: adb disconnect
	
See what Wi-Fi interfaces are available:
	netsh wlan show interfaces
